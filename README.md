# Groovy-Spock-and-Geb-Test-Automation

Just to learn more about test automation with these frameworks.

If environment variables GROOVY_HOME, JAVA_HOME aren't set and respective bins not included on PATH as well, there is a batch file available to set it up easily if you download and move Groovy and a JDK folder to the same folder as this repository.

P.S.: I wasn't able to compile and check throughout every code yet, I made this very fast through notepad directly because at the time I didn't have a development environment available and not enough time to setup it but by the time I'll refactory them.

Demo test 1 - OK
2nd and third - still pending to be checked.
